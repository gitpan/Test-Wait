Test::Wait is a tool for use in conjunction with test libraries such as Test::More for manual testing purposes.

It was initially designed for use in Selenium based tests however it can be used in any test script.

Test::Wait provides functions that allow you to pause test scripts at any given point, allowing you to inspect the test output
in a browser or terminal OR use the test-created data to run manual tests against an application.
